                My name is Moises D. Cruz and this is my E-Commerce Website.
                This site is made just using HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript, it took 
                quite some days to finish. I focus on C++ language and
                wanted to go over the top with this proyect to prove I can learn fast
                and to challenge myself to try new things. This site has been made as both a college proyect
                and a personal proyect, as it has improved since then. Amazing!
